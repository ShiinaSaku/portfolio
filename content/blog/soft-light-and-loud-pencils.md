I used to treat writing like a mood problem. If I felt inspired, I wrote. If not, I stalled.

That approach worked occasionally, but it was unreliable. I needed something repeatable.

## The setup I actually use

Before I start, I set the environment in a specific order:

1. Warm desk lamp on.
2. Notifications off.
3. One open document only.
4. Pen and notebook for quick outline notes.

This takes less than two minutes. The point is not aesthetics. The point is reducing friction.

## Why the timer matters

I run a 15-minute timer for the first pass. During that block, I only do two things:

- Write the opening paragraph.
- List the next three section headers.

No editing. No link hunting. No formatting.

Most drafts fail at the beginning because we mix drafting and judging too early. The timer forces those stages apart.

## A practical quality check

After the first pass, I do one short review:

- Did I state the problem clearly?
- Did I include one concrete example?
- Did I end with an actionable takeaway?

If any answer is "no", I fix that before touching style.

This routine is not creative magic. It is basic operational discipline. But it consistently gives me publishable drafts faster than waiting for the perfect mood.
