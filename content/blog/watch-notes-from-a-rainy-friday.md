On Friday evenings, I rewatch selected scenes and keep a small reference log.

This is not a review process. It is a design research habit.

## What I capture

For each scene, I write down four things:

- Dominant color family.
- Contrast level (low, medium, high).
- Camera distance (wide, medium, close).
- Emotional intent in one sentence.

This keeps notes specific. "Beautiful shot" is not useful later. "Low-contrast green palette with close framing for quiet tension" is useful.

## Translating notes into interface work

I map those observations to UI choices:

- Low-contrast scenes -> softer card borders and lower saturation accents.
- High-contrast scenes -> stronger hierarchy for headings and primary actions.
- Close framing -> tighter spacing for intimate sections like profile cards.

The value is not imitation. The value is a repeatable lens for visual decisions.

## Why this works in teams

When design decisions are explained with references, reviews are faster.

Instead of saying "I like this color," I can say "We used a muted warm range here to keep focus on the copy, based on the same contrast strategy from our reference scenes."

That shifts the conversation from taste to rationale.
